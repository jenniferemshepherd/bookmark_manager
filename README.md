# bookmark_manager

As a user
So that I can quickly revisit important websites
I would like to see a list of bookmarked links

As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly find web sites I recently bookmarked
I would like to see links in descending chronological order

As a user
So that I can save an important website
I would like to store a new bookmark with title and URL

As a user
So that I can sort my bookmarks by category
I would like to add a tag to my bookmarks

As a user
So that I can find a bookmark quickly
I would like to filter links by tag
